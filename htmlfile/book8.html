        <h5>Book Description</h5>
        <p>After her closest friend and cousin Abigail was turned down by the gentry after it was discovered that her father was a bigamist, Lady Jessica Archer lost interest in the dazzling pleasure of romance. Jessica, however, decides it's time to be married now that she's 25. Even though she no longer thinks she will find real love, she is still incredibly qualified. Avery Archer, Duke of Netherby, is her sibling, after all. Jessica thinks about all the capable men that are interested in her. But then she meets the mysterious Gabriel Thorne, who has returned to England from the New World to claim an equally mysterious inheritance. Jessica views him as being wholly unfit, especially after he declares his intention to marry her while they are still hardly known.

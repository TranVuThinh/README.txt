            <h5>Book Description</h5>
            <p>The story of a determined child with enormous goals who doesn't let any of the doubters get in the way is told by well-known comic author James Breakwell. Tommy is absolutely certain of his future career. However, when he declares his intention to become a pterodactyl, it turns out that he is surrounded by doubters. What should a youngster who has a lofty goal do? He isn't about to give up, to start with. He also has many excellent responses. Tommy's dad, who is incredibly accepting and who supports him in finding a solution to his problem, is a tremendous asset. Tommy's journey to pterodactyldom will have children supporting him
